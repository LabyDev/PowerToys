# Museum
This folder contains two Python scripts that I wrote roughly a decade ago while I was first learning to program.

These files are intentionally preserved in their original form and serve as inspiration for this project. They represent the starting point of my programming career.

I am now working professionally in software development.

# randomfileopener.py
A script that:
- Recursively scans a directory
- Randomly selects a file
- Opens it using the system’s default application
- Uses a cache file to persist and reuse file ordering

This was a start for me to learn Python and programming, I just had the idea to randomly open a file.

# sorter.py
A script that:

- Scans the current directory
- Compares file names to folder names using similarity matching
- Moves files into matching folders
- Creates new folders when necessary
- Supports ignored word filtering

I had a legitimate use for it back then, so it naturally followed the first script.
